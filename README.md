# ukk-crud-inventory
This is  a CRUD Inventory Program with the database.
The project is to fullfill The Competency Final Exam.
I know it has a lot of bugs, but I'm still learning and trying to apply my logic theory.

This project has been created using php, codeigniter, and database.
Also the system flow is about inventory in school. When the teacher using inventory stuff so he/she must use the system to track and record the stuff is it available or not.
